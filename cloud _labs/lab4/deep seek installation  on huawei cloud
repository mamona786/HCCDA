üåê Deploying DeepSeek on Huawei Cloud (Cloud / Enterprise Use)

If your intent is to set up DeepSeek on Huawei Cloud, possibly for enterprise, development, or AI inference purposes (instead of using the mobile app), you can deploy DeepSeek-R1 using Huawei ECS + Docker + Ollama + Open WebUI.

Here's a streamlined deployment guide based on official resources:

Step 1: Deploy Huawei Cloud Stack

Use the Quick Deployment template "Building a DeepSeek Inference System".

Choose your region and parameters: VPC, ECS instance specs (e.g. x1.16u.16g for 7B/8B model), security groups, root credentials, and optionally enable Dify for web interaction  .


Step 2: Remote Login & Model Setup

After deployment (~10 minutes), use CloudShell or SSH tools (PuTTY, MobaXterm) to access the ECS instance via its public IP  .

On the VM, install Docker if using CPU-based instance:

ollama run deepseek-r1:<model-size>

where <model-size> can be 1.5b, 7b, or 8b depending on instance specs  .


Step 3: (Optional) UI Setup with Open WebUI or Dify

If you didn't enable Dify, you can manually run:

docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --name open-webui ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main

Make sure to add inbound firewall rules for ports 11434 (Ollama) and 3000 (WebUI) in your ECS security group  .

Access Open WebUI via browser at http://<ECS-public-IP>:3000 to log in and interact with DeepSeek  .


Step 4: Chat and Use

Use CLI (terminal) or WebUI to talk with DeepSeek. To end model sessions, type /bye if using CLI  .
